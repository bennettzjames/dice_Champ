#Dice Champ#

I've wanted to make a dice game since the second week of the course. I'm glad that it didn't work with the prompts for the other projects, because now I have the abilities to make it the way I want it to be. Dice Champ will consist of at least two different dice games. The user must beat his or her opponent to advance to the next stage. I plan on using the spotify API to allow the user to listen to music while playing the game. 

I know the front end will made with jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I'd like to dicuss the pro's and cons of my server and database choice before commiting to them.
