Dice Champ is a game that allows the user to play dice games against a computer. The dice games are regionally based. Cee-Lo is the predominant game of choice on the East Coast, while Street Craps is played in the Mid-west and Boxcars is played on the West Coast(coming soon!). 

Dice Champ was built with Express, Node.js, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and will soon include ajax and Handlebars.js
