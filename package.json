  "description": "I've wanted to make a dice game since the second week of the course. I'm glad that it didn't work with the prompts for the other projects, because now I have the abilities to make it the way I want it to be. Dice Champ will consist of at least two different dice games. The user must beat his or her opponent to advance to the next stage. I plan on using the spotify API to allow the user to listen to music while playing the game.",
